Over the past months I've been working in my spare time on a Django based website, [allTEFL](http://www.allTEFL.com), a sort of Glassdoor site for TEFL teachers. This was the project that first made me want to learn to program, and it is hugely exciting to see it come to life.

This is the first in a series of posts in which I'll describe how I designed and organized the site, then talk about some of the fun coding challenges I came across as I worked on it.

First we'll walk through some simple user stories, then talk about how use case scenarios affected how I created my models.

###User Stories

At first, I figured that there would basically be three things that would happen:

1. A `Teacher` creates an account so she can review a school (`school_review`) or a recruiter (`recruiter_review`).
2. A `Teacher` adds a `school_review` to the database. This is publicly viewable as an anonymous post on the `School`'s page.
3. Specific data from the `school_review` (school name, dates of employment) is visible in the `Teacher`'s  `resume_view`.

###Putting the Parts Together
Creating a `Teacher` model was easy; use Django's `auth.User` model. The `School` model has proven to be much more interesting.

###The `School`

A `Teacher` has a one-to-many relationship with `School`s that she's taught at and reviewed.

First, a complication: there is no complete list of all the English schools or TEFL recruiters in China. Thus, (2) above has a problem: the `Teacher`'s `School` may not exist in the database. So let's revise my user stories:


1. A `Teacher` adds a `school_review` for a `School` in the database.
  * If the `School` is not in the database already, the `Teacher` adds it before reviewing it.

Cool. But as it turns out, doing this is a bit harder than it seemed at first glance.

Letting a user add `School`s to the database is problematic because we don't want data to be fragmented. (One teacher might enter `Beijing High School`, but another teacher from the same school might look for `BHS` and then create a new instance of the `School` model.) So it's important to make finding your school's name as streamlined and precise as possible, reducing peoples' temptation to not look and just add a new school.

We could just add schools by name, but this is problematic because `School`s may well share names. For example, there are a number of chain schools, similar to test prep behemoths Kaplan or Princeton Review in the US. We want to make sure Wall Street English in Wudaokou, Beijing is distinguishable from WSE in Zhongguancun, Beijing. Also, users will doubtless want to look up schools by location So, just having a list of schools organized by name is not an appropriate way to organize the db.

## Chained Selects in Django

So, how about a **chained lookup** in our form. A chained lookup means finding all Y that belong to X. This will allow us to select schools (and enter them into the database) based on location. The user can select a `Province`, which brings up a list of all its `City`. After selecting the `City`, you can either (a) select your `School` or (b) `add_school` to the database if necessary.

> Country -> Province List -> City List -> Schools  
> e.g.  
> `China -> Jilin -> Changchun -> Sino-American Denver Foreign Language School`

But to do this, I need a list of all the provinces (and their constituent cities) in a given country. That sounds like quite a bit of work to do by handâ€¦so surely someone's automated it, right?

There are two Django packages that can be combined to (a) populate tables with country, province/state, and city data, and (b) make it easy to build geographic chained selections: [django-cities-light](https://github.com/yourlabs/django-cities-light) and [django-smart-selects](https://github.com/digi604/django-smart-selects). Below I will show you how to use the two together to create your own forms in Django that automatically whittle down information from the database to

For my use case it's been necessary to make custom models so I can have views for city, region, and city. Because of this, I need to use the abstract models included in `cities_light`.

```python
#models.py

from cities_light.abstract_models import AbstractCountry, AbstractRegion, AbstractCity
```

These are our necessary imports. First, we are using the generic models from `django-cities-light`: `Country`, `Region`, and `City`.

**IMPORTANT** There is [a known bug in `django-cities-light`'s abstract models](https://github.com/yourlabs/django-cities-light/issues/89) that requires you to declare your models in the same order that you imported the `Abstract` models.

```python
from cities_light.abstract_models import AbstractCountry, AbstractRegion, AbstractCity
from cities_light.receivers import connect_default_signals


#models.py

class Country(AbstractCountry):

    pass
connect_default_signals(Country)


class Region(AbstractRegion):

    pass
connect_default_signals(Region)


class City(AbstractCity):

    pass
connect_default_signals(City)
```

We need to register our custom models in the site's `settings.py`:

```python
# settings.py

CITIES_LIGHT_TRANSLATION_LANGUAGES = ['zh', 'en'] # I want to include both Chinese & English names
CITIES_LIGHT_INCLUDE_COUNTRIES = ['CN'] # Download geographic information for China.
CITIES_LIGHT_APP_NAME = 'app_name' # Let the app know that I have custom models, defined in this app.
```

From the terminal we now need to run `./manage.py cities_light` to populate the tables. Three tables will be created: `country`, `region`, and `city`. The tables have a bunch of columns in them. The most important are:

`country`

| id | name_ascii | slug |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| 1  | China      | china|

`region`

| Header One     | Header Two     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Item One       | Item Two       |

| id | name_ascii | slug | display_name | country_id |
|:-----:|:------------:|:------:|:------------:|:-----------------:|
| 2  | Qinghai    | qinghai | Qinghai, China | Foreign Key |

Worth noting that this model has a foreign key, `country_id`, that associates with a `country`.

`city`

| id | name_ascii | slug | display_name | country_id | region_id |
|:-----:|:------------:|:------:|:------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| 1 | Rikaze | rikaze |Rikaze, Tibet Autonomous Region, China | ForeignKey(country_id) | ForeignKey(region_id) |

Two foreign keys here - `country_id` and `region_id`.

The tables include multiple versions of the location's name. I've found `name_ascii` and `display_name` to be the two most useful. THe latter includes province and country.

### Linking to City/Province/Country views

Our existing models are nice, but I want to be able to link to views for each of these models. This means writing a `get_absolute_url` function for them in my models, adding URL patterns to `urls.py`, and adding views for each.

```python
    # models.py
    class Country(AbstractCountry):

        def get_absolute_url(self):
            return reverse('country_school_list',
                           kwargs={'country_slug': self.slug})

    connect_default_signals(Country)


    class Region(AbstractRegion):

        def get_absolute_url(self):
            return reverse('province_school_list',
                           kwargs={'country_slug': self.country.slug,
                                   'province_slug': self.slug})

    connect_default_signals(Region)


    class City(AbstractCity):

        def get_absolute_url(self):
            return reverse('city_school_list',
                           kwargs={'country_slug': self.country.slug,
                                   'province_slug': self.region.slug,
                                   'city_slug': self.slug})

    connect_default_signals(City)


    # urls.py

        url(r'^schools/(?P<country_slug>[\w-]+)/$',
            CountrySchoolList.as_view(),
            name='country_school_list'),
        url(r'^schools/(?P<country_slug>[\w-]+)/(?P<province_slug>[\w-]+)/$',
            ProvinceSchoolList.as_view(),
            name='province_school_list'),
        url(r'^schools/(?P<country_slug>[\w-]+)/(?P<province_slug>[\w-]+)/(?P<city_slug>[\w-]+)/$',
            CitySchoolList.as_view(),
            name='city_school_list'),


    # views.py

    from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView, CreateView
    from .models import School, Country, Region, City


    class CountrySchoolList(ListView):

        model = School
        template_name = "school_reviews/school_list.html"
        ordering = ('school_province', 'school_city', 'school_name')

        def get_queryset(self, **kwargs):
            self.country = get_object_or_404(Country, slug=self.kwargs['country_slug'])
            return School.objects.filter(school_country=self.country)

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            context = super(CountrySchoolList, self).get_context_data(**kwargs)
            context['section'] = 'country'
            return context


    class ProvinceSchoolList(ListView):

        model = School

        ordering = ('school_city', 'school_name')

            return School.objects.filter(school_country=self.country,
                                         school_province=self.province)

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            context = super(ProvinceSchoolList, self).get_context_data(**kwargs)
            context['section'] = 'province'
            return context


    class CitySchoolList(ListView):

        model = School
        template_name = "school_reviews/school_list.html"
        ordering = ('school_name')

        def places(self, **kwargs):
            country = get_object_or_404(Country, slug=self.kwargs['country_slug'])
            province = get_object_or_404(Region, slug=self.kwargs['province_slug'])
            city = get_object_or_404(City, slug=self.kwargs['city_slug'])
            return country, province, city

        def get_queryset(self, **kwargs):
            self.country = get_object_or_404(Country, slug=self.kwargs['country_slug'])
            self.province = get_object_or_404(Region, slug=self.kwargs['province_slug'])
            self.city = get_object_or_404(City, slug=self.kwargs['city_slug'])
            return School.objects.filter(school_country=self.country,
                                         school_province=self.province,
                                         school_city=self.city)

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            context = super(CitySchoolList, self).get_context_data(**kwargs)
            context['section'] = 'city'
            context['country'] = get_object_or_404(Country, slug=self.kwargs['country_slug'])
            return context

The last thing we need to do is write
